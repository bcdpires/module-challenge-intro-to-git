## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
A version control system of collaborations among programmers.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the language & GitHub is the platform.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
So we can make our own edits, that can later be added into the main 
branch after our team leader's verification.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
To show changes in our branches to other people.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout <main>

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch = downloads contents from a repo; git merge = combines 
two branches; git pull = fetch & download a repo + update local repo to 
match that content.

7. What is a merge conflict?
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve 
differences in code between two commits. Git can merge the changes 
automatically only if the commits are on different lines or branches. 

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
We must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new 
commit.
